# TMDBProject-MVP

This **android app** does the same functions that the [TMDBProject](https://github.com/fvaldiviadev/TMDBProject) of this repository, but it is developed with **Model View Presenter** ([MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter)) arquitecture.   

I remember you that this app shows a list of popular movies from [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). **When the scroll reaches the end of the list, automatically load the next pages**.
Furthermore, the user has the possibility to search for a movie by keyword and the **search is automatically triggered while user is typing**. The search results can be scrollable via pagination as well.

This project has been developed in **Java**, using **Android Studio** and implementing the libraries **Retrofit and Glide**.
